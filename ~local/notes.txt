So the number of symbols returned may be less than requested.
When multiple symbols are requested here, null is returned for invalid symbols.

Yahoo rounds the adjusted price to 2 decimals even though dividend amounts often have 3 decimal places.
Since they apply the adjustment formula to adjusted prices, if you go far enough back in time,
the value they give for Adjusted Price will be different than it would be if there were no rounding.
